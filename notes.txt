could use chromaprint to create audio fingerprint of bark and compare with 3 fingerprints from small, medium and large dog barks

In each string of barks the barks are going to have to be segmented out as separate barks, pyAudioAnalysis can do this
apparently using sementation learning. I beleive i have to supply some ideal barks (e.g. 20) for it to distinguish the unique
sound.

use pyaudioanalyse to create a classification thing from the default barks folder, then classify the whole split folder and
see what happens

so the classification thing seems to return numbers or some shit to the console, still unsure what it does
i think you need to get folder classification working as that might return soemthing different OR give it some different sounds
in the classification

The sound recording should automatically call silenceRemoval then automatically call classify folder
i will also need a cron tab to remove all old folders every like day or what ever
